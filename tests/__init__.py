Viral Clips Testing Framework

This package contains modular tests for each stage of the viral clips pipeline:
- Stage 1: Preprocessing (video/audio to audio)
- Stage 2: Transcription (audio to transcript with timestamps)
- Stage 3: Segment Identification (transcript to viral segments)
- Stage 4: Clip Creation (media + timestamps to video clips)

Each stage can be tested independently.
